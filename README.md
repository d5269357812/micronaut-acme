[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zendern/micronaut-acme.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zendern/micronaut-acme)

This project includes integration between [Micronaut](http://micronaut.io) and [ACME ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Certificate_Management_Environment) via [Acme4j](https://shredzone.org/maven/acme4j/index.html).

The Micronaut ACME integration can be used together with any ACME server to provide ssl certificates for your application. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is currently
