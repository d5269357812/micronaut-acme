Utilizing `dns` challenge type allows validation to be done via entry of a DNS TXT record. Currently
the application will log out a message that looks as follows.

.DNS output

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
							CREATE DNS `TXT` ENTRY AS FOLLOWS
				_acme-challenge.example.com with value 79ZNJaxlcLYIFootHL6Rrbh2VUCfFGgPeurVyjoRrS8
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Once this is output you will need to log into your DNS provider and create a TXT entry with the following key and value.

* key: `_acme-challenge.example.com`
* value: `79ZNJaxlcLYIFootHL6Rrbh2VUCfFGgPeurVyjoRrS8`

Since this is a manual process you will also want to bump out your `acme.auth.pause` duration so that there is enough time between retries
and time take for the manual entry/DNS propagation.

acme:
  challenge-type: 'dns'
  auth:
    # Due to the current manual nature in which the dns validation has to be done currently
    # we change the amount of time we wait before trying to authorize again to make sure there
    # is time for us logging into the dns interface, setting a TXT record and waiting for it
    # to propagate.
    pause: 2m
