Once you have downloaded or built from source you now need to setup your PATH

* Extract the binary to appropriate location (For example: `C:\micronaut-acme-cli`)
* Create an environment variable `MICRONAUT_ACME_HOME` which points to the installation directory i.e. `C:\micronaut-acme-cli`
* Update the `PATH` environment variable, append `%MICRONAUT_ACME_HOME%\bin`.

You should now be able to run the Micronaut CLI from the command prompt as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ acme-cli --help
