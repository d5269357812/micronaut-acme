Once you have downloaded or built from source you now need to setup your PATH

In your shell profile (~/.bash_profile if you are using the Bash shell), export the MICRONAUT_ACME_HOME directory and add the CLI path to your PATH:

.bash_profile/.bashrc
[source,bash]
----
export MICRONAUT_ACME_HOME=~/path/to/micronaut-acme-cli
export PATH="$PATH:$MICRONAUT_ACME_HOME/bin"
----

Reload your terminal or `source` your shell profile with `source`:

[source,bash]
----
> source ~/.bash_profile
----


You should now be able to run the Micronaut CLI from the command prompt as follows:

[source,bash]
----
$ acme-cli --help
----
